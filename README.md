# My Q3 Data Analytics Assignment
This assignment put my fresh skills in Data Visualization and Machine Learning to the test. During the first part, I was loosely guided through the process of gaining intuition about the traffic and pollution data, visualizing data with matplotlib and finally trying to predict air quality more or less successfully. For the second part, I had to come up with a hypothesis on my own in order to then gain more insight, this time without guidance. Data was transformed into information, which I then presented on a poster, using the visualization techniques learned during the course.
